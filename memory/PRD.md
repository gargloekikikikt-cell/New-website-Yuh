# SwapFlow - Pinterest-Style Trading Platform

## Original Problem Statement
Build a website that allows people to post images on items they want to trade with, in a Pinterest format. Features include Google sign-up, profile with username/photo, item clicking, messaging between users, "trade finished" button (both parties must confirm), trade points display on profile, and 1-5 star ratings after trades.

## User Personas
1. **Trader**: Wants to exchange items without money
2. **Browser**: Discovers items and connects with owners
3. **Active Trader**: Builds reputation through successful trades

## Core Requirements (Static)
- Pinterest-style masonry grid layout
- Emergent-managed Google OAuth authentication
- Direct file upload for item images
- Single-word categories (most clicked go to top)
- In-app messaging between users
- Trade confirmation (both parties must click "Trade Finished")
- Trade points awarded on completion
- Post-trade rating system (1-5 stars)
